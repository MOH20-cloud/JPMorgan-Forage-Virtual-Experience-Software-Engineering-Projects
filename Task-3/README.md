# Task 3 - Data Handling with Spring Boot

##  Overview
In this task, I worked on handling and returning data in a Spring Boot application.  
The focus was to **build a simple data model** and **expose it through RESTful endpoints**.

##  Steps Implemented
1. Set up a **data model class** to represent objects.  
2. Created a **service layer** to manage in-memory data.  
3. Exposed endpoints through a **controller** for testing CRUD operations.  
4. Verified that JSON responses were correctly serialized and returned to the client.
